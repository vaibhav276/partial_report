<p>When you look at letters while you read text, how many of the letters
can you interpret in a single glance? Or how many numbers can you
distinguish if you briefly glance at them?

<p>This has been the subject of many research studies, and the results
showed that people could, on an average, report about 4.5 characters from a
brief glance. This was an established limit for many years, until
experiments from George Sperling (1960) questioned these limits.

<p>The experiment of "partial report" is one of the experiments George
Sperling did to demonstrate that the actual limit is not just 4.5 but much
larger than that. The main reason the average came out to be 4.5 before was
that the information "fades away" with time very quickly. In fact, if the
reporting is done after one second or more, then only about 4-5 items are
reported. But if the reporting is done much before that (a few
milliseconds), then the entire visual field is available and people
can correctly report any part of it.

<p>However, a perfect reporting takes some practice and precise conditions
(constant distance between eyes and screen, etc.), so it is difficult to
get the perfect result every time, especially for new participants.

<p>This application will help you train yourself for one version of the
experiment and also undergo the actual experiment multiple times. You can
also look at your historical reports to see how you progress with practice
and look at the evidence of the phenomenon.
